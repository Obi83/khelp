# ProxFox.sh

## Introduction

`ProxFox.sh` is a comprehensive bash script designed to enhance your system's security and privacy by automating the installation and configuration of various tools and services. These services include ProxyChains, Tor, UFW, Fail2Ban, iptables, and more. The script is intended to be run with root privileges, as it requires access to system directories and services.

## Features

- Automatic installation of essential security and privacy tools.
- Configures and manages ProxyChains, Tor, UFW, Fail2Ban, iptables, and more.
- Enhanced logging with log rotation and detailed formatting.
- Validates and fetches proxy lists from multiple APIs.
- Detects and configures local network IP ranges.
- Sets up systemd services and timers for automated tasks.
- Provides detailed logs and status checks for all operations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The script must be run as root.
- The system should have internet access to fetch packages and proxy lists.
- Basic understanding of Linux system administration is recommended.

   - `/var/log/khelp_iptables.log`

## Script Overview

### Initial Checks and Environment Setup

- The script checks if it is run as root.
- Sets up environment variables for paths, configurations, and log files.
- Defines logging levels and functions for enhanced logging.

### Logo Display

- A function to display a logo is defined and called at the beginning of the script.

### System Update

- The script updates the system using `apt` and handles retries in case of failures.

### Package Installation

- Installs essential packages including `curl`, `tor`, `ufw`, `jq`, `iptables`, `fail2ban`, `sslh`, `proxychains`, `openssl`, `logwatch`, and `rsyslog`.
- Each installation is handled with retries and logging.

### Configuration

- Configures UFW, Fail2Ban, iptables, Tor, ProxyChains, `resolv.conf`, and OpenSSL.
- Creates necessary configuration files and directories.
- Ensures systemd services are created, enabled, and started for UFW, iptables, and proxy updates.
- Sets up monitoring tools and syslog configuration.

### Proxy Fetching

- Fetches proxy lists from multiple APIs with fallback mechanisms.
- Validates URLs and logs the process.

### Systemd Services

- Creates and manages systemd services and timers for automated tasks.

### Network and Service Checks

- Detects local network IP ranges.
